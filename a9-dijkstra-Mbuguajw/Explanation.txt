Roadtrip Explanation:
In creating this graph, I wanted to only consider the categories of distance, traffic, and tour attractions. Therefore
I disregarded the entire column as scenery, since I am typically either asleep during these trips or too focused on the
road. From there, I took the recorded distance between each edge, and divided by the rating of traffic between each edge.
The ranking of traffic ranged from 1-7, seven being "No Traffic", six being "Light", five "Low", four being "Medium",
three "Average", two "Moderate", and one being "Heavy Traffic". Then the distance would be be divided by the intensity
of the traffic. The less traffic, the more the distance's edge would lessen. Then all the scenery drives would be added
to the quotients of these, and finally the attractions ratings would once more divide these edge totals. The
attractions would be rated on a scale of 1-5, based on how interesting/fun they appeared to be. One represented a poor
collection of attractions, while five showed an elite collection of attractions. That is how all of the factors of
the road trip will be taken account for when calculating the weight of an edge.
